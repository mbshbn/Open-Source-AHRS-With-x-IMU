The x-IMU‘s propriety on-board IMU and AHRS sensor fusion algorithms provide a real-time measurement of orientation relative to the Earth. Many projects require access to algorithm source code so that it may be run off-board, modified or used to post-process sensor data and take advantage of non-real-time techniques. This open source project implements Madgwick’s AHRS and IMU algorithms in C# and demonstrates their real-time performance alongside the x-IMU’s own propriety algorithm. The source code also includes Madgwick’s implementation of Robert Mayhony’s so called ‘DCM filter‘ in quaternion form.
